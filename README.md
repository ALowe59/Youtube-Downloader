# Youtube_code
Code that interacts with the Youtube API, it will download a video and convert the video into a mp4 file and there will also be a txt file which contains the description of the video.

Note: python_youtube_downloader uses test_links.csv to run. If you would like to test it out with other videos, copy and replace the youtube code (after the watch?v= in the url)
